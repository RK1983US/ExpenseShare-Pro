# ExpenseShare Pro - Troubleshooting Guide

## Application Not Starting

### ✅ **All Issues Resolved**
All major issues have been resolved in the current release. The application is now fully functional.

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **Import Errors**
If you see import errors, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. **Missing Dependencies**
The application requires these core packages:
- `tkinter` (usually comes with Python)
- `tkcalendar`
- `PIL` (Pillow)
- `requests`
- `fpdf`

#### 3. **Python Version Issues**
- Ensure you're using Python 3.7 or higher
- Check with: `python --version`

#### 4. **File Permissions**
- Make sure you have read/write permissions in the application directory
- On Windows, try running as administrator if needed

#### 5. **Data File Issues**
- If the application crashes on startup, it might be due to corrupted data files
- Delete `splitwise_data.json` to reset the application data
- The application will create a new data file on next startup
